Modern excavations have uncovered a "massive palisade of teak beams held together with iron dowels".[7] A huge apadana-like hall with eighty sandstone columns shows clear influence from contemporary Achaemenid Persia.[8] The single massive sandstone Pataliputra capital shows clear Hellenistic features, reaching India via Persia.[9] The famous Ashoka columns show great sophistication, and a variety of influences in their details. In both these cases a now-vanished Indian predecessor tradition in wood is likely.[10]
